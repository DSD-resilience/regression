# Create a logistic regression model to predict 'am' based on 'mpg'
model <- glm(am ~ mpg, data = mtcars, family = binomial)

# Summarize the model
summary(model)

# Model looks something like this:
# Call:
# glm(formula = am ~ mpg, family = binomial, data = mtcars)

# Deviance Residuals: 
#   Min       1Q   Median       3Q      Max  
# -1.8483  -0.8483   0.4113   0.6327   1.6823  

# Coefficients:
#            Estimate Std. Error z value Pr(>|z|)    
# (Intercept)  -12.3793     4.0785  -3.034  0.00242 **

#    Null deviance: 43.230  on 31  degrees of freedom
# Residual deviance: 23.299  on 30  degrees of freedom
# AIC: 27.299

# Number of Fisher Scoring iterations: 6
# Coefficients: The Estimate column shows the estimated coefficients for the intercept and the mpg variable. A positive coefficient for mpg suggests that higher mpg values are associated with a higher probability of having a manual transmission (am = 1).
# Significance: The Pr(>|z|) column shows the p-values for the coefficients. If the p-value is below a certain threshold (e.g., 0.05), the coefficient is considered statistically significant.
